Welcome to pyPreservica's documentation
========================================

pyPreservica is python library for the Preservica API

This library provides a Python class for working with the Preservica Entity Rest API

This version of the library is compatible with Preservica versions 6.0 and 6.1

Why Should I Use This?
----------------------

The goal of pyPreservica is to allow you to make use of the Preservica Entity API for reading and writing objects within
a Preservica repository without having to manage the underlying REST HTTPS requests and XML parsing.
The library provides a level of abstraction which reflects the underlying data model, such as structural and
information objects.

The pyPreservica library allows Preservica users to build applications which interact with the repository such as metadata
synchronisation with 3rd party systems etc.

.. hint::
    Access to the Preservica API's for the cloud hosted system does depend on which Preservica Edition has been
    licensed.  See https://preservica.com/digital-archive-software/products-editions for details.

Background
-----------

They key to working with the pyPreservica library is that the services follow the Preservica core data model closely.

.. image:: images/entity-API.jpg

The Preservica data model represents a hierarchy of entities, starting with the **structural objects** which are used to represent aggregations of digital assets. Structural objects define the organisation of the data. In a library context they may be referred to as collections, in an archival context they may be Fonds, Sub-Fonds, Series etc and in a records management context they could be simply a hierarchy of folders or directories.

These structural objects may contain other structural objects in the same way as a computer filesystem may contain folders within folders.

Within the structural objects comes the **information objects**. These objects which are sometimes referred to as the digital assets are what PREMIS defines as an Intellectual Entity. Information objects are considered a single intellectual unit for purposes of management and description: for example, a book, document, map, photograph or database etc.

**Representations** are used to define how the information object are composed in terms of technology and structure. For example, a book may be represented as a single multiple page PDF, a single eBook file or a set of single page image files.

Representations are usually associated with a use case such as access or long-term preservation. All Information objects have a least one representation defined by default. Multiple representations can be either created outside of Preservica through a process such as digitisation or within Preservica through preservation processes such a normalisation.

**Content Objects** represent the components of the asset. Simple assets such as digital images may only contain a single content object whereas more complex assets such as books or 3d models may contain multiple content objects. In most cases content objects will map directly to digital files or bitstreams.

**Generations** represent changes to content objects over time, as formats become obsolete new generations may need to be created to make the information accessible.

**Bitstreams** represent the actual computer files as ingested into Preservica, i.e. the TIFF photograph or the PDF document.

Example
------------

Create the entity API client object and request an asset (information object) by its unique identifier ::
    
    >>> from pyPreservica import *
    >>> client = EntityAPI()
    >>> asset = client.asset("9bad5acf-e7a1-458a-927d-2d1e7f15974d")
    >>> print(asset.title)
    


Authentication
-----------------

pyPreservica provides 3 different methods for authentication. The library requires the username and password of a Preservica user and a Tenant identifier along with the server hostname.


1 **Method Arguments**

Include the user credentials as arguments to the EntityAPI Class ::

    >>> from pyPreservica import *
    >>> client = EntityAPI(username="test@test.com", password="123444", tenant="PREVIEW", server="preview.preservica.com")


If you don't want to include your Preservica credentials within your python script then the following two methods should
be used.

2 **Environment Variable**

Export the credentials as environment variables as part of the session ::

    $ export PRESERVICA_USERNAME="test@test.com"
    $ export PRESERVICA_PASSWORD="123444"
    $ export PRESERVICA_TENANT="PREVIEW"
    $ export PRESERVICA_SERVER="preview.preservica.com"

    $ python3

    >>> from pyPreservica import *
    >>> client = EntityAPI()
    
3 **Properties File**

Create a properties file called "credentials.properties" and save to the working directory ::

    [credentials]
    username=test@test.com
    password=123444
    tenant=PREVIEW
    server=preview.preservica.com
    
    >>> from pyPreservica import *
    >>> client = EntityAPI()


You can create a new credentials.properties file automatically using the save_config() method ::

   >>> from pyPreservica import *
   >>> client = EntityAPI(username="test@test.com", password="123444", tenant="PREVIEW", server="preview.preservica.com")
   >>> client.save_config()


SSL Certificates
-----------------

pyPreservica will only connect to servers which use the https:// protocol and will always validate certificates.

pyPreservica uses the Certifi project to provide SSL certificate validation.

Self-signed certificates used by on-premise deployments are not part of the Certifi CA bundle and need to be set
explicitly.

For on-premise deployments the trusted CAs can be specified through the REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE environment variable. e.g. ::

    export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/my-server.cert



The User Guide
--------------

Entity API QuickStart
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Making a call to the Preservica repository is very simple.

Begin by importing the pyPreservica module ::

    >>> from pyPreservica import *
    
Now, let's create the EntityAPI class ::

    >>> client = EntityAPI()

Fetching Entities (Assets, Folders & Content Objects)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    
Fetch an asset and print its attributes ::

    >>> asset = client.asset("9bad5acf-e7a1-458a-927d-2d1e7f15974d")
    >>> print(asset.reference)
    >>> print(asset.title)
    >>> print(asset.description)
    >>> print(asset.security_tag)
    >>> print(asset.parent)
    >>> print(asset.entity_type)
    

We can also fetch the same attributes for both folders  ::

    >>> folder = client.folder("0b0f0303-6053-4d4e-a638-4f6b81768264")
    >>> print(folder.reference)
    >>> print(folder.title)
    >>> print(folder.description)
    >>> print(folder.security_tag)
    >>> print(folder.parent)
    >>> print(folder.entity_type)

and content objects ::

    >>> content_object = client.content_object("1a2a2101-6053-4d4e-a638-4f6b81768264")
    >>> print(content_object.reference)
    >>> print(content_object.title)
    >>> print(content_object.description)
    >>> print(content_object.security_tag)
    >>> print(content_object.parent)
    >>> print(content_object.entity_type)

We can fetch any of assets, folders and content objects using the entity type and the unique reference ::

    >>> asset = client.entity(EntityType.ASSET, "9bad5acf-e7a1-458a-927d-2d1e7f15974d")
    >>> folder = client.entity(EntityType.FOLDER, asset.parent)

To get the parent objects of an asset all the way to the root of the repository ::

    >>> folder = client.folder(asset.parent)
    >>> print(folder.title)
    >>> while folder.parent is not None:
    >>>     folder = client.folder(folder.parent)
    >>>     print(folder.title)


Fetching Children of Entities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The immediate children of a folder can also be retrieved using the library.

To get a set of all the root folders use ::

    >>> root_folders = client.children(None)

or ::

    >>> root_folders = client.children()



To get a set of children of a particular folder use ::

    >>> entities = client.children(folder.reference)

To get the siblings of an asset you can use ::

    >>> entities = client.children(asset.parent)

The set of entities returned may contain both assets and other folders.
The default size of the result set is 50 items. The size can be configured and for large result sets
paging is available. ::

    >>> next_page = None
    >>> while True:
    >>>     root_folders = client.children(None, maximum=10, next_page=next_page)
    >>>     for e in root_folders.results:
    >>>         print(f'{e.title} : {e.reference} : {e.entity_type}')
    >>>         if not root_folders.has_more:
    >>>             break
    >>>         else:
    >>>             next_page = root_folders.next_page


A version of this method is also available as a generator function which does not require explicit paging.
This version returns a lazy iterator which does the paging internally.
It will default to 50 items between server requests ::

    >>> for entity in client.descendants():
    >>>     print(entity.title)
    >>>

You can pass a parent reference to get the children of any folder in the same way as the explict paging version ::

    >>> for entity in client.descendants(folder.parent):
    >>>     print(entity.title)

This is the preferred way to get children of folders as the paging is managed automatically.

If you only need the folders or assets from a parent you can filter the results using a pre-defined filter ::

    >>> for asset in filter(only_assets, client.descendants(asset.parent)):
    >>>     print(asset.title)

or ::

    >>> for folders in filter(only_folders, client.descendants(asset.parent)):
    >>>     print(folders.title)


If you want **all** the entities below a point in the hierarchy, i.e a recursive list of all folders and assets the you can
call all_descendants() this is a generator function which returns a lazy iterator will which make repeated calls to the server
for each page of results.

The following will return all entities within the repository from the root folders down ::

    >>> for e in client.all_descendants()
    >>>     print(e.title)

again if you need a list of every asset in the system you can filter using ::

    >>> for asset in filter(only_assets, client.all_descendants()):
    >>>     print(asset.title)



Creating new Folders
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Folder objects can be created directly in the repository, the create_folder() function takes 3
mandatory parameters, folder title, description and security tag. ::

    >>> new_folder = client.create_folder("title", "description", "open")
    >>> print(new_folder.reference)

This will create a folder at the top level of the repository. You can create child folders by passing the reference of the parent as the
last argument. ::

    >>> new_folder = client.create_folder("title", "description", "open", folder.reference)
    >>> print(new_folder.reference)
    >>> assert  new_folder.parent == folder.reference


Updating Entities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can update either the title or description attribute for assets, folders and content objects using the save() method ::

    >>> asset = client.asset("9bad5acf-e7a1-458a-927d-2d1e7f15974d")
    >>> asset.title = "New Asset Title"
    >>> asset.description = "New Asset Description"
    >>> asset = client.save(asset)

    >>> folder = client.folder("0b0f0303-6053-4d4e-a638-4f6b81768264")
    >>> folder.title = "New Folder Title"
    >>> folder.description = "New Folder Description"
    >>> folder = client.save(folder)

    >>> content_object = client.content_object("1a2a2101-6053-4d4e-a638-4f6b81768264")
    >>> content_object.title = "New Content Object Title"
    >>> content_object.description = "New Content Object Description"
    >>> content_object = client.save(content_object)

To change the security tag on an Asset or Folder we have a separate API. Since this may be a long running process for folders containing
many assets you can choose either a asynchronous (non-blocking) or synchronous (blocking call)

This is the asynchronous call which returns immediately returning a process id ::

    >>> pid = client.security_tag_async(entity, new_tag)

The synchronous version will block until the security tag has been updated on all entities. ::

    >>> entity = client.security_tag_sync(entity, new_tag)


3rd Party External Identifiers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can add external identifiers to either assets, folders or content objects. External identifiers have a type and a value.
External identifiers do not have to be unique in the same way as internal identifiers. ::

    >>> asset = client.asset("9bad5acf-e7ce-458a-927d-2d1e7f15974d")
    >>> client.add_identifier(asset, "ISBN", "978-3-16-148410-0")
    >>> client.add_identifier(asset, "DOI", "https://doi.org/10.1109/5.771073")
    >>> client.add_identifier(asset, "URN", "urn:isan:0000-0000-2CEA-0000-1-0000-0000-Y")

Fetch external identifiers on an entity. This call returns a set of tuples (identifier_type, identifier_value) ::

    >>> identifiers = client.identifiers_for_entity(folder)
    >>> for identifier in identifiers:
    >>>     identifier_type = identifier[0]
    >>>     identifier_value = identifier[1]

You can search the repository for entities with matching external identifiers. The call returns a set of objects
which may include any type of entity. ::

    >>> for e in client.identifier("ISBN", "978-3-16-148410-0"):
    >>>     print(e.entity_type, e.reference, e.title)

.. note::
    Entities within the set only contain the attributes (type, reference and title). If you need the full object you have to request it.

For example ::

    >>> for e in client.identifier("DOI", "urn:nbn:de:1111-20091210269"):
    >>>     o = client.entity(e.entity_type, e.reference)
    >>>     print(o.title)
    >>>     print(o.description)

To delete identifiers attached to an entity ::

    >>> client.delete_identifiers(entity)

Will delete all identifiers on the entity ::

    >>> client.delete_identifiers(entity, identifier_type="ISBN")

Will delete all identifiers which have type "ISBN" ::

     >>> client.delete_identifiers(entity, identifier_type="ISBN", identifier_value="122334")

Will only delete identifiers which match the type and value

Descriptive Metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can query an entity to determine if it has any attached descriptive metadata using the metadata attribute. This returns a dict[] object
the dictionary key is a url to the metadata and the value is the schema ::

    >>> for url, schema in entity.metadata.items():
    >>>     print(url, schema)

The descriptive XML metadata document can be returned as a string by passing the key of the map to the metadata() method ::

    >>> for url in entity.metadata:
    >>>     xml_document = client.metadata(url)

An alternative is to call the metadata_for_entity method directly ::

    >>> xml_document = client.metadata_for_entity(entity, "https://www.person.com/person")

to fetch the first metadata template which matches the schema argument on the entity


Metadata can be attached to entities either by passing an XML document as a string::

    >>> folder = entity.folder("723f6f27-c894-4ce0-8e58-4c15a526330e")

    >>>  xml = "<person:Person  xmlns:person='https://www.person.com/person'>" \
            "<person:Name>Bob Smith</person:Name>" \
            "<person:Phone>01234 100 100</person:Phone>" \
            "<person:Email>test@test.com</person:Email>" \
            "<person:Address>Abingdon, UK</person:Address>" \
            "</person:Person>"

    >>> folder = client.add_metadata(folder, "https://www.person.com/person", xml)

or by reading the metadata from a file ::

    >>> with open("DublinCore.xml", 'r', encoding="UTF-8") as md:
    >>>     asset = client.add_metadata(asset, "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/", md)


Descriptive metadata can also be updated to amend values or change the document structure ::

    >>> folder = entity.folder("723f6f27-c894-4ce0-8e58-4c15a526330e")   # call into the API
    >>>
    >>> for url, schema in folder.metadata.items():
    >>>     if schema == "https://www.person.com/person":
    >>>         xml_string = entity.metadata(url)                    # call into the API
    >>>         xml_document = ElementTree.fromstring(xml_string)
    >>>         postcode = ElementTree.Element('{https://www.person.com/person}Postcode')
    >>>         postcode.text = "OX14 3YS"
    >>>         xml_document.append(postcode)
    >>>         xml_string = ElementTree.tostring(xml_document, encoding='UTF-8', xml_declaration=True).decode("utf-8")
    >>>         entity.update_metadata(folder, schema, xml_string)   # call into the API


Representations, Content Objects & Generations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each asset in Preservica contains one or more representations, such as Preservation or Access etc.

To get a list of all the representations of an asset ::

    >>> for representation in client.representations(asset):
    >>>     print(representation.rep_type)
    >>>     print(representation.name)
    >>>     print(representation.asset.title)

Each Representation will contain one or more content objects.
Simple assets contain a single content object whereas more complex objects such as 3D models, books, multi-page documents
may have several content objects. ::

    >>> for content_object in client.content_objects(representation):
    >>>     print(content_object.reference)
    >>>     print(content_object.title)
    >>>     print(content_object.description)
    >>>     print(content_object.parent)
    >>>     print(content_object.metadata)
    >>>     print(content_object.asset.title)

Each content object will contain a least one generation, migrated content may have multiple generations. ::

    >>> for generation in client.generations(content_object):
    >>>     print(generation.original)
    >>>     print(generation.active)
    >>>     print(generation.content_object)
    >>>     print(generation.format_group)
    >>>     print(generation.effective_date)
    >>>     print(generation.bitstreams)

Each Generation has a list of BitStream ids which can be used to fetch the actual content from the server or
fetch technical metadata about the bitstream itself::

    >>> for bs in generation.bitstreams:
    >>>     print(bs.filename)
    >>>     print(bs.length)
    >>>     print(bs.length)
    >>>     for algorithm,value in bs.fixity.items():
    >>>         print(algorithm,  value)

The actual content files can be download using bitstream_content() ::

    >>> client.bitstream_content(bs, bs.filename)


Moving Entities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can move entities between folders using the move call ::

    >>> client.move(entity, dest_folder)

Where entity is the object to move either an asset or folder and the second argument is destination folder where the entity is moved to.

Folders can be moved to the root of the repository by passing None as the second argument. ::

    >>> client.move(folder, None)


Finding Updated Entities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can query Preservica for entities which have changed over the last n days using ::

    >>> for e in client.updated_entities(previous_days=30):
    >>>     print(e)

The argument is the number of previous days to check for changes. This call does paging internally.

The pyPreservica library also provides a web service call which is part of the content API which allows downloading of digital
content directly without having to request the representations and generations first.
This call is a short-cut to request the bitstream from the latest generation of the first content object in the Access representation
of an asset. If the asset does not have an access representation then the preservation representation is used.

For very simple assets which comprise a single digital file in a single representation then this call will probably do what you expect. ::

    >>> asset = client.asset("edf403d0-04af-46b0-ab21-e7a620bfdedf")
    >>> filename = client.download(asset, "asset.jpg")

For complex multi-part assets which have been through preservation actions it may be better to use the data model and the bitstream_content() function
to fetch the exact bitstream you need.

We also have a function to fetch the thumbnail image for an asset or folder ::

    >>> asset = client.asset("edf403d0-04af-46b0-ab21-e7a620bfdedf")
    >>> filename = client.thumbnail(asset, "thumbnail.jpg")

You can specify the size of the thumbnail by passing a second argument ::

    >>> asset = client.asset("edf403d0-04af-46b0-ab21-e7a620bfdedf")
    >>> filename = client.thumbnail(asset, "thumbnail.jpg", Thumbnail.LARGE)     ## 400×400   pixels
    >>> filename = client.thumbnail(asset, "thumbnail.jpg", Thumbnail.MEDIUM)    ## 150×150   pixels
    >>> filename = client.thumbnail(asset, "thumbnail.jpg", Thumbnail.SMALL)     ## 64×64     pixels



Content API QuickStart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

pyPreservica now contains some experimental interfaces to the content API

https://demo.preservica.com/api/content/documentation.html

The content API is a readonly interface which returns json documents rather than XML and which has some duplication with the entity API, but it does contain search capabilities.


.. warning::
    Unlike the entity API above the interfaces for the content API are subject to change.

The content API client is created using ::

    >>> from pyPreservica import *
    >>> client = ContentAPI()


object-details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Get the details for a Asset or Folder as a raw json document::

    >>> client = ContentAPI()
    >>> client.object_details("IO", "uuid")
    >>> client.object_details("SO", "uuid")


indexed-fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Get a list of all the indexed metadata fields within the solr server. This includes the default
xip.* fields and any custom indexes which have been created through custom index files. ::

    >>> client = ContentAPI()
    >>> client.indexed_fields():

Search
^^^^^^^^^

Search the repository using a single expression which matches on any indexed field. ::

    >>> client = ContentAPI()
    >>> client.simple_search_csv()

Searches for everything and writes the results to a csv file called "search.csv", by default the csv
columns contain reference, title, description, document_type, parent_ref, security_tag ::

You can pass the query term as the first argument (% is the wildcard character) and the csv file name as the second argument. ::

    >>> client = ContentAPI()
    >>> client.simple_search_csv("%", "results.csv")

    >>> client = ContentAPI()
    >>> client.simple_search_csv("Oxford", "oxford.csv")

    >>> client = ContentAPI()
    >>> client.simple_search_csv("History of Oxford", "history.csv")

The last argument is an optional list of indexed fields which are the csv file columns. ::

    >>> client = ContentAPI()
    >>> metadata_fields = ["xip.reference", "xip.title", "xip.description", "xip.document_type", "xip.parent_ref", "xip.security_descriptor"]
    >>> client.simple_search_csv("%", "results.csv", metadata_fields)


or to include everything except the full text index value ::

    >>> client = ContentAPI()
    >>> everything = list(filter(lambda x: x != "xip.full_text", client.indexed_fields()))
    >>> client.simple_search_csv("%", "results.csv", everything)



Entity API Developer Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This part of the documentation covers all the interfaces of pyPreservica.


All of the pyPreservica functionality can be accessed by these  methods on the :class:`EntityAPI <EntityAPI>` object.

.. py:class:: EntityAPI

   .. py:method:: asset(reference)

    Returns an asset object back by its internal reference identifier

    :param str reference: The unique identifier for the asset usually its uuid

   .. py:method::  folder(reference)

    Returns a folder object back by its internal reference identifier

    :param str reference: The unique identifier for the asset usually its uuid
    :return: The folder object
    :rtype: Folder
    :raises RuntimeError: if the identifier is incorrect

   .. py:method:: content_object(reference)

    Returns a content object back by its internal reference identifier

    :return: The updated entity
    :rtype: Entity

   .. py:method:: security_tag_async(entity, new_tag)

Example Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Updating a descriptive metadata element value**

If you need to bulk update metadata values the following script will check every asset in a folder given by the "folder-uuid"
and find the matching descriptive metadata document by its namespace "your-xml-namespace".
It will then find a particular element in the xml document "your-element-name" and update its value. ::

    from xml.etree import ElementTree
    from pyPreservica import *
    client = EntityAPI()
    folder = client.folder("folder-uuid")
    next_page = None
    while True:
        children = client.children(folder.reference, maximum=10, next_page=next_page)
        for entity in children.results:
            if entity.entity_type is EntityAPI.EntityType.ASSET:
                asset = client.asset(entity.reference)
                for url, schema in asset.metadata.items():
                    if schema == "your-xml-namespace":
                        xml_document = ElementTree.fromstring(client.metadata(url))
                        field_with_error = xml_document.find('.//{your-xml-namespace}your-element-name')
                        if hasattr(field_with_error, 'text'):
                            if field_with_error.text == "Old Value":
                                field_with_error.text = "New Value"
                                asset = client.update_metadata(asset, schema, ElementTree.tostring(xml_document, encoding='UTF-8', xml_declaration=True).decode("utf-8"))
                                print("Updated asset: " + asset.title)
        if not children.has_more:
            break
        else:
            next_page = children.next_page


The following script does the same thing as above but uses the function descendants() rather than children().
The difference is that descendants() does the paging of results internally and combined with
a filter() on the lazy iterator provides a version which does not need the additional while loop or if statement! ::

    client = EntityAPI()
    folder = client.folder("folder-uuid")
    for child_asset in filter(only_assets, client.descendants(folder.reference)):
        asset = client.asset(child_asset.reference)
        document = ElementTree.fromstring(client.metadata_for_entity(asset, "your-xml-namespace"))
        field_with_error = document.find('.//{your-xml-namespace}your-element-name')
        if hasattr(field_with_error, 'text'):
            if field_with_error.text == "Old Value":
                field_with_error.text = "New Value"
                new_xml = ElementTree.tostring(document, encoding='UTF-8', xml_declaration=True).decode("utf-8")
                asset = client.update_metadata(asset, "your-xml-namespace", new_xml)
                print("Updated asset: " + asset.title)

**Adding Metadata from a Spreadsheet**

One common use case which can be solved with pyPreservica is adding descriptive metadata to existing Preservica assets or folders
using metadata held in a spreadsheet. Normally each column in the spreadsheet contains a metadata attribute and each row represents a
different asset.

The following is a short python script which uses pyPreservica to update assets within Preservica
with Dublin Core Metadata held in a spreadsheet.

The spreadsheet should contain a header row. The column name in the header row
should start with the text "dc:" to be included.
There should be one column called "assetId" which contains the reference id for the asset to be updated.

The metadata should be saved as a UTF-8 CSV file called dublincore.csv ::

    import xml
    import csv
    from pyPreservica import *

    OAI_DC = "http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/"
    DC = "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
    XSI = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

    entity = EntityAPI()

    headers = list()
    with open('dublincore.csv', encoding='utf-8-sig', newline='') as csvfile:
        reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
        for row in reader:
            for header in row:
                headers.append(header)
            break
        if 'assetId' in headers:
            for row in reader:
                assetID = None
                xml_object = xml.etree.ElementTree.Element('oai_dc:dc', {"xmlns:oai_dc": OAI_DC, "xmlns:dc": DC, "xmlns:xsi": XSI})
                for value, header in zip(row, headers):
                    if header.startswith('dc:'):
                        xml.etree.ElementTree.SubElement(xml_object, header).text = value
                    elif header.startswith('assetId'):
                        assetID = value
                xml_request = xml.etree.ElementTree.tostring(xml_object, encoding='utf-8', xml_declaration=True).decode('utf-8')
                asset = entity.asset(assetID)
                entity.add_metadata(asset, OAI_DC, xml_request)
        else:
            print("The CSV file should contain a assetId column containing the Preservica identifier for the asset to be updated")



**Creating Searchable Transcripts from Oral Histories**

The following is an example python script which uses a 3rd party Machine Learning API to automatically generate a text
transcript from an audio file such as a WAVE file.
The transcript is then uploaded to Preservica, is stored as metadata attached to an asset and indexed so that the audio or oral history is searchable.

This example uses the AWS https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/ service, but other AI APIs are also available.
AWS provides a free tier https://aws.amazon.com/free/ to allow you to try the service for no cost.

This python script does require a set of AWS credentials to use the AWS transcribe service.

The python script downloads a WAV file using its reference, uploads it to AWS S3 and then starts the transcription service,
when the transcript is available it creates a metadata document containing the text and uploads it to Preservica.::

    import os,time,uuid,xml,boto3,requests
    from pyPreservica import *

    BUCKET = "com.my.transcribe.bucket"
    AWS_KEY = '.....'
    AWS_SECRET = '........'
    REGION = 'eu-west-1'
    ## download the file to the local machine
    client = EntityAPI()
    asset = client.asset('91c73c95-a298-448c-a5a3-2295e5052be3')
    client.download(asset, f"{asset.reference}.wav")
    # upload the file to AWS
    s3_client = boto3.client('s3', region_name=REGION, aws_access_key_id=AWS_KEY, aws_secret_access_key=AWS_SECRET)
    response = s3_client.upload_file(f"{asset.reference}.wav", BUCKET, f"{asset.reference}")
    # Start the transcription service
    transcribe = boto3.client('transcribe', region_name=REGION, aws_access_key_id=KEY, aws_secret_access_key=SECRET)
    job_name = str(uuid.uuid4())
    job_uri = f"https://s3-{REGION}.amazonaws.com/{BUCKET}/{asset.reference}"
    transcribe.start_transcription_job(TranscriptionJobName=job_name,  Media={'MediaFileUri': job_uri}, MediaFormat='wav', LanguageCode='en-US')
    while True:
        status = transcribe.get_transcription_job(TranscriptionJobName=job_name)
        if status['TranscriptionJob']['TranscriptionJobStatus'] in ['COMPLETED', 'FAILED']:
            break
        print("Still working on the transcription....")
        time.sleep(5)
    # upload the transcript text to Preservica
    if status['TranscriptionJob']['TranscriptionJobStatus'] == 'COMPLETED':
        result_url = status['TranscriptionJob']['Transcript']['TranscriptFileUri']
        json = requests.get(result_url).json()
        text = json['results']['transcripts'][0]['transcript']
        xml_object = xml.etree.ElementTree.Element('tns:Transcript', {"xmlns:tns": "https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/"})
        xml.etree.ElementTree.SubElement(xml_object, "Transcription").text = text
        xml_request = xml.etree.ElementTree.tostring(xml_object, encoding='utf-8', xml_declaration=True).decode('utf-8')
        client.add_metadata(asset, "https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/", xml_request)   # add the xml transcript
        s3_client.delete_object(Bucket=BUCKET, Key=asset.reference)   # delete the temp file from s3
        os.remove(f"{asset.reference}.wav")    # delete the local copy
