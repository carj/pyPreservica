pyPreservica is a Python client for the Preservica API Services

This library provides a Python class for working with the Preservica Rest API

https://developers.preservica.com/api-reference

This version of the documentation is for use against a Preservica 6.2 system

For Preservica 6.0 and 6.1 see `the previous version <https://pypreservica.readthedocs.io/en/v6.1/>`_

Why Should I Use This?
----------------------

The goal of pyPreservica is to allow you to make use of the Preservica Entity API for reading and writing objects within
a Preservica repository without having to manage the underlying REST HTTPS requests and XML parsing.
The library provides a level of abstraction which reflects the underlying data model, such as structural and
information objects.

The pyPreservica library allows Preservica users to build applications which interact with the repository such as metadata
synchronisation with 3rd party systems etc.

.. hint::
    Access to the Preservica API's for the cloud hosted system does depend on which Preservica Edition has been
    licensed.  See https://preservica.com/digital-archive-software/products-editions for details.

Background
-----------

They key to working with the pyPreservica library is that the services follow the Preservica core data model closely.

.. image:: images/entity-API.jpg

The Preservica data model represents a hierarchy of entities, starting with the **structural objects** which are used to
represent aggregations of digital assets. Structural objects define the organisation of the data. In a library context
they may be referred to as collections, in an archival context they may be Fonds, Sub-Fonds, Series etc and in a
records management context they could be simply a hierarchy of folders or directories.

These structural objects may contain other structural objects in the same way as a computer filesystem may contain
folders within folders.

Within the structural objects comes the **information objects**. These objects which are sometimes referred to as the
digital assets are what PREMIS defines as an Intellectual Entity. Information objects are considered a single
intellectual unit for purposes of management and description: for example, a book, document, map, photograph or database etc.

**Representations** are used to define how the information object are composed in terms of technology and structure.
For example, a book may be represented as a single multiple page PDF, a single eBook file or a set of single page image files.

Representations are usually associated with a use case such as access or long-term preservation.
All Information objects have a least one representation defined by default. Multiple representations can be either
created outside of Preservica through a process such as digitisation or within Preservica through preservation processes such a normalisation.

**Content Objects** represent the components of the asset. Simple assets such as digital images may only contain a
single content object whereas more complex assets such as books or 3d models may contain multiple content objects.
In most cases content objects will map directly to digital files or bitstreams.

**Generations** represent changes to content objects over time, as formats become obsolete new generations may need
to be created to make the information accessible.

**Bitstreams** represent the actual computer files as ingested into Preservica, i.e. the TIFF photograph or the PDF document.

Example
------------

Create the entity API client object and request an Asset (Information Object) by its unique identifier ::

    >>> from pyPreservica import *
    >>> client = EntityAPI()
    >>> client
    pyPreservica version: 0.8.5  (Preservica 6.2 Compatible)
    Connected to: us.preservica.com Version: 6.2.0 as test@test.com
    >>> asset = client.asset("dc949259-2c1d-4658-8eee-c17b27a8823d")
    >>> asset.title
    'LC-USZ62-20901'
    >>> asset.parent
    'ae108c8f-b058-4228-b099-6049175d2f0c'
    >>> asset.security_tag
    'open'
    >>> asset.entity_type
    <EntityType.ASSET: 'IO'>



Authentication
-----------------

pyPreservica provides 4 different methods for authentication. The library requires the username and password of a
Preservica user and a Tenant identifier along with the server hostname.


1 **Method Arguments**

Include the user credentials as arguments to the EntityAPI Class ::

    >>> from pyPreservica import *
    >>> client = EntityAPI(username="test@test.com", password="123444",
                           tenant="PREVIEW", server="preview.preservica.com")


If you don't want to include your Preservica credentials within your python script then the following two methods should
be used.

2 **Environment Variable**

Export the credentials as environment variables as part of the session ::

    $ export PRESERVICA_USERNAME="test@test.com"
    $ export PRESERVICA_PASSWORD="123444"
    $ export PRESERVICA_TENANT="PREVIEW"
    $ export PRESERVICA_SERVER="preview.preservica.com"

    $ python3

    >>> from pyPreservica import *
    >>> client = EntityAPI()
    
3 **Properties File**

Create a properties file called "credentials.properties" and save to the working directory ::

    [credentials]
    username=test@test.com
    password=123444
    tenant=PREVIEW
    server=preview.preservica.com
    
    >>> from pyPreservica import *
    >>> client = EntityAPI()


You can create a new credentials.properties file automatically using the ``save_config()`` method ::

   >>> from pyPreservica import *
   >>> client = EntityAPI(username="test@test.com", password="123444",
                          tenant="PREVIEW", server="preview.preservica.com")
   >>> client.save_config()



4 **Shared Secrets**

pyPreservica now supports authentication using shared secrets rather than a login account username and password.
This allows a trusted external applications such as pyPreservica to acquire a Preservica API authentication token
without having to use a set of login credentials.

To use the shared secret authentication you need to add a secure secret key to your Preservica system.

The username, password, tenant and server attributes are used as normal, the password field now holds the shared
secret and not the users password. ::

   >>> from pyPreservica import *
   >>> client = EntityAPI(username="test@test.com", password="shared-secret", tenant="PREVIEW",
                          server="preview.preservica.com", use_shared_secret=True)



   >>> from pyPreservica import *
   >>> client = EntityAPI(use_shared_secret=True)




SSL Certificates
-----------------

pyPreservica will only connect to servers which use the https:// protocol and will always validate certificates.

pyPreservica uses the Certifi project to provide SSL certificate validation.

Self-signed certificates used by on-premise deployments are not part of the Certifi CA bundle and need to be set
explicitly.

For on-premise deployments the trusted CAs can be specified through the ``REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`` environment variable. e.g. ::

    export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/my-server.cert



The User Guide
--------------

Entity API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Making a call to the Preservica repository is very simple.

Begin by importing the pyPreservica module ::

    >>> from pyPreservica import *
    
Now, let's create the ``EntityAPI`` class ::

    >>> client = EntityAPI()

Fetching Entities (Assets, Folders & Content Objects)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    
Fetch an Asset and print its attributes ::

    >>> asset = client.asset("9bad5acf-e7a1-458a-927d-2d1e7f15974d")
    >>> print(asset.reference)
    >>> print(asset.title)
    >>> print(asset.description)
    >>> print(asset.security_tag)
    >>> print(asset.parent)
    >>> print(asset.entity_type)
    

We can also fetch the same attributes for both Folders  ::

    >>> folder = client.folder("0b0f0303-6053-4d4e-a638-4f6b81768264")
    >>> print(folder.reference)
    >>> print(folder.title)
    >>> print(folder.description)
    >>> print(folder.security_tag)
    >>> print(folder.parent)
    >>> print(folder.entity_type)

and Content Objects ::

    >>> content_object = client.content_object("1a2a2101-6053-4d4e-a638-4f6b81768264")
    >>> print(content_object.reference)
    >>> print(content_object.title)
    >>> print(content_object.description)
    >>> print(content_object.security_tag)
    >>> print(content_object.parent)
    >>> print(content_object.entity_type)

We can fetch any of Assets, Folders and Content Objects using the entity type and the unique reference ::

    >>> asset = client.entity(EntityType.ASSET, "9bad5acf-e7a1-458a-927d-2d1e7f15974d")
    >>> folder = client.entity(EntityType.FOLDER, asset.parent)

To get a list of parent Folders of an Asset all the way to the root of the repository ::

    >>> folder = client.folder(asset.parent)
    >>> print(folder.title)
    >>> while folder.parent is not None:
    >>>     folder = client.folder(folder.parent)
    >>>     print(folder.title)


Fetching Children of Entities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The immediate children of a Folder can also be retrieved using the library.

To get a set of all the root Folders use ::

    >>> root_folders = client.children(None)

or ::

    >>> root_folders = client.children()



To get a set of children of a particular Folder use ::

    >>> entities = client.children(folder.reference)

To get the siblings of an Asset you can use ::

    >>> entities = client.children(asset.parent)

The set of entities returned may contain both Assets and other Folders.
The default size of the result set is 50 items. The size can be configured and for large result sets
paging is available. ::

    >>> next_page = None
    >>> while True:
    >>>     root_folders = client.children(None, maximum=10, next_page=next_page)
    >>>     for e in root_folders.results:
    >>>         print(f'{e.title} : {e.reference} : {e.entity_type}')
    >>>         if not root_folders.has_more:
    >>>             break
    >>>         else:
    >>>             next_page = root_folders.next_page




A version of this method is also available as a generator function which does not require explicit paging.
This version returns a lazy iterator which does the paging internally.
It will default to 50 items between server requests ::

    >>> for entity in client.descendants():
    >>>     print(entity.title)
    >>>

You can pass a parent reference to get the children of any folder in the same way as the explict paging version ::

    >>> for entity in client.descendants(folder.parent):
    >>>     print(entity.title)

This is the preferred way to get children of folders as the paging is managed automatically.

If you only need the folders or Assets from a parent you can filter the results using a pre-defined filter ::

    >>> for asset in filter(only_assets, client.descendants(asset.parent)):
    >>>     print(asset.title)

or ::

    >>> for folders in filter(only_folders, client.descendants(asset.parent)):
    >>>     print(folders.title)



.. note::
    Entities within the returned set only contain the attributes (type, reference and title).
    If you need the full object you have to request it.



If you want **all** the entities below a point in the hierarchy, i.e a recursive list of all folders and Assets the you can
call ``all_descendants()`` this is a generator function which returns a lazy iterator which will make
repeated calls to the server for each page of results.

The following will return all entities within the repository from the root folders down ::

    >>> for e in client.all_descendants():
    >>>     print(e.title)

again if you need a list of every Asset in the system you can filter using ::

    >>> for asset in filter(only_assets, client.all_descendants()):
    >>>     print(asset.title)



Creating new Folders
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Folder objects can be created directly in the repository, the ``create_folder()`` function takes 3
mandatory parameters, folder title, description and security tag. ::

    >>> new_folder = client.create_folder("title", "description", "open")
    >>> print(new_folder.reference)

This will create a folder at the top level of the repository. You can create child folders by passing the reference of the parent as the
last argument. ::

    >>> new_folder = client.create_folder("title", "description", "open", folder.reference)
    >>> print(new_folder.reference)
    >>> assert  new_folder.parent == folder.reference


Updating Entities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can update either the title or description attribute for assets, folders and content objects using the ``save()`` method ::

    >>> asset = client.asset("9bad5acf-e7a1-458a-927d-2d1e7f15974d")
    >>> asset.title = "New Asset Title"
    >>> asset.description = "New Asset Description"
    >>> asset = client.save(asset)

    >>> folder = client.folder("0b0f0303-6053-4d4e-a638-4f6b81768264")
    >>> folder.title = "New Folder Title"
    >>> folder.description = "New Folder Description"
    >>> folder = client.save(folder)

    >>> content_object = client.content_object("1a2a2101-6053-4d4e-a638-4f6b81768264")
    >>> content_object.title = "New Content Object Title"
    >>> content_object.description = "New Content Object Description"
    >>> content_object = client.save(content_object)

To change the security tag on an Asset or Folder we have a separate API. Since this may be a long running process.
You can choose either a asynchronous (non-blocking) call which returns immediately or synchronous (blocking call) which
waits for the security tag to be changed before returning.

This is the asynchronous call which returns immediately returning a process id ::

    >>> pid = client.security_tag_async(entity, new_tag)

You can determine the current status of the asynchronous call by passing the argument to ``get_async_progress`` ::

    >>> status = client.get_async_progress(pid)


The synchronous version will block until the security tag has been updated on the entity.
This call does not recursively change entities within a folder. It only applies to the named entity passed as an argument. ::

    >>> entity = client.security_tag_sync(entity, new_tag)


3rd Party External Identifiers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

3rd party or external identifiers are a useful way to provide additional names or identities to objects to
provide an alternate way of accessing them.
For example if you are synchronising metadata between an external metadata catalogue and Preservica adding the catalogue
identifiers to the Preservica objects allows the catalogue to query Preservica using its own ids.

Each Preservica entity can hold as many external identifiers as you need.

.. note::
    Adding, Updating and Deleting external identifiers is only available in version 6.1 and above

We can add external identifiers to either Assets, Folders or Content Objects. External identifiers have a name or type
and a value. External identifiers do not have to be unique in the same way as internal identifiers.
The same external identifiers can be added to multiple entities to form sets of objects. ::

    >>> asset = client.asset("9bad5acf-e7ce-458a-927d-2d1e7f15974d")
    >>> client.add_identifier(asset, "ISBN", "978-3-16-148410-0")
    >>> client.add_identifier(asset, "DOI", "https://doi.org/10.1109/5.771073")
    >>> client.add_identifier(asset, "URN", "urn:isan:0000-0000-2CEA-0000-1-0000-0000-Y")


Fetch external identifiers on an entity. This call returns a set of tuples (identifier_type, identifier_value) ::

    >>> identifiers = client.identifiers_for_entity(folder)
    >>> for identifier in identifiers:
    >>>     identifier_type = identifier[0]
    >>>     identifier_value = identifier[1]

You can search the repository for entities with matching external identifiers. The call returns a set of objects
which may include any type of entity. ::

    >>> for e in client.identifier("ISBN", "978-3-16-148410-0"):
    >>>     print(e.entity_type, e.reference, e.title)

.. note::
    Entities within the set only contain the attributes (type, reference and title). If you need the full object you have to request it.

For example ::

    >>> for e in client.identifier("DOI", "urn:nbn:de:1111-20091210269"):
    >>>     o = client.entity(e.entity_type, e.reference)
    >>>     print(o.title)
    >>>     print(o.description)

To delete identifiers attached to an entity ::

    >>> client.delete_identifiers(entity)

Will delete all identifiers on the entity ::

    >>> client.delete_identifiers(entity, identifier_type="ISBN")

Will delete all identifiers which have type "ISBN" ::

     >>> client.delete_identifiers(entity, identifier_type="ISBN", identifier_value="978-3-16-148410-0")

Will only delete identifiers which match the type and value

Descriptive Metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can query an entity to determine if it has any attached descriptive metadata using the metadata attribute.
This returns a dictionary object the dictionary key is a url which can be used to the fetch metadata
and the value is the schema name::

    >>> for url, schema in entity.metadata.items():
    >>>     print(url, schema)

The descriptive XML metadata document can be returned as a string by passing the key of the map (url)
to the ``metadata()`` method ::

    >>> for url in entity.metadata:
    >>>     xml_document = client.metadata(url)

An alternative is to call the ``metadata_for_entity``  directly ::

    >>> xml_document = client.metadata_for_entity(entity, "https://www.person.com/person")

this will fetch the first metadata document which matches the schema argument on the entity


Metadata can be attached to entities either by passing an XML document as a string::

    >>> folder = entity.folder("723f6f27-c894-4ce0-8e58-4c15a526330e")

    >>>  xml = "<person:Person  xmlns:person='https://www.person.com/person'>" \
            "<person:Name>Bob Smith</person:Name>" \
            "<person:Phone>01234 100 100</person:Phone>" \
            "<person:Email>test@test.com</person:Email>" \
            "<person:Address>Abingdon, UK</person:Address>" \
            "</person:Person>"

    >>> folder = client.add_metadata(folder, "https://www.person.com/person", xml)

or by reading the metadata from a file ::

    >>> with open("DublinCore.xml", 'r', encoding="UTF-8") as md:
    >>>     asset = client.add_metadata(asset, "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/", md)


Descriptive metadata can also be updated to amend values or change the document structure
To update an existing metadata document call ::

    >>>  client.update_metadata(entity, schema, xml_string)

For example the following python fragment appends a new element to an existing document. ::

    >>> folder = client.folder("723f6f27-c894-4ce0-8e58-4c15a526330e")   # call into the API
    >>>
    >>> for url, schema in folder.metadata.items():
    >>>     if schema == "https://www.person.com/person":
    >>>         xml_string = client.metadata(url)                    # call into the API
    >>>         xml_document = ElementTree.fromstring(xml_string)
    >>>         postcode = ElementTree.Element('{https://www.person.com/person}Postcode')
    >>>         postcode.text = "OX14 3YS"
    >>>         xml_document.append(postcode)
    >>>         xml_string = ElementTree.tostring(xml_document, encoding='UTF-8').decode("utf-8")
    >>>         entity.update_metadata(folder, schema, xml_string)   # call into the API


Representations, Content Objects & Generations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each asset in Preservica contains one or more representations, such as Preservation or Access etc.

To get a list of all the representations of an Asset ::

    >>> for representation in client.representations(asset):
    >>>     print(representation.rep_type)
    >>>     print(representation.name)
    >>>     print(representation.asset.title)

Each Representation will contain one or more Content Objects.
Simple Assets contain a single Content Object whereas more complex objects such as 3D models, books, multi-page documents
may have several content objects. ::

    >>> for content_object in client.content_objects(representation):
    >>>     print(content_object.reference)
    >>>     print(content_object.title)
    >>>     print(content_object.description)
    >>>     print(content_object.parent)
    >>>     print(content_object.metadata)
    >>>     print(content_object.asset.title)

Each content object will contain a least one Generation, migrated content may have multiple Generations. ::

    >>> for generation in client.generations(content_object):
    >>>     print(generation.original)
    >>>     print(generation.active)
    >>>     print(generation.content_object)
    >>>     print(generation.format_group)
    >>>     print(generation.effective_date)
    >>>     print(generation.bitstreams)

Each Generation has a list of BitStream ids which can be used to fetch the actual content from the server or
fetch technical metadata about the bitstream itself::

    >>> for bitstream in generation.bitstreams:
    >>>     print(bitstream.filename)
    >>>     print(bitstream.length)
    >>>     for algorithm,value in bitstream.fixity.items():
    >>>         print(algorithm,  value)

The actual content files can be download using ``bitstream_content()`` ::

    >>> client.bitstream_content(bitstream, bitstream.filename)



Integrity Check History
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can request the history of all integrity checks which have been carried out on a bitstream ::

    >>> for bitstream in generation.bitstreams:
    >>>     for check in client.integrity_checks(bitstream):
    >>>         print(check)

The list of returned checks includes both full and quick integrity checks.

.. note::
    This call does not start a new check, it only returns information about previous checks.

Moving Entities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can move entities between folders using the ``move`` call ::

    >>> client.move(entity, dest_folder)

Where entity is the object to move either an Asset or Folder and the second argument is
destination folder where the entity is moved to.

Folders can be moved to the root of the repository by passing None as the second argument. ::

    >>> entity = client.move(folder, None)

The ``move()`` call is an alias for ``move_sync()`` which is a synchronous (blocking call)::

    >>> entity = client.move_sync(entity, dest_folder)

An asynchronous (non-blocking) version is also available which returns a progress id. ::

    >>> pid = client.move_async(entity, dest_folder)

You can determine the completed status of the asynchronous move call by passing the
argument to ``get_async_progress`` ::

    >>> status = client.get_async_progress(pid)


Deleting Entities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can initiate and approve a deletion request using the API.

.. note::
    Deletion is a two stage process within Preservica and requires two distinct sets of credentials.
    To use the delete functions you must be using the "credentials.properties" authentication method.


.. note::
    The Deletion API is only available when connected to Preservica version 6.2 or above


Add manager.username and manager.password to the credentials file. ::

    [credentials]
    username=
    password=
    server=
    tenant=
    manager.username=
    manager.password=


Deleting an asset ::

    >>> asset_ref = client.delete_asset(asset, "operator comments", "supervisor comments")
    >>> print(asset_ref)

Deleting a folder ::

    >>> folder_ref = client.delete_folder(folder, "operator comments", "supervisor comments")
    >>> print(folder_ref)


.. warning::
    This API call deletes entities within the repository, it both initiates and approves the deletion request
    and therefore must be used with care.



Finding Updated Entities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can query Preservica for entities which have changed over the last n days using ::

    >>> for e in client.updated_entities(previous_days=30):
    >>>     print(e)

The argument is the number of previous days to check for changes. This call does paging internally.

The pyPreservica library also provides a web service call which is part of the content API which allows downloading of digital
content directly without having to request the Representations and Generations first.
This call is a short-cut to request the Bitstream from the latest Generation of the first Content Object in the Access
Representation of an Asset. If the asset does not have an Access Representation then the
Preservation Representation is used.

For very simple assets which comprise a single digital file in a single Representation
then this call will probably do what you expect. ::

    >>> asset = client.asset("edf403d0-04af-46b0-ab21-e7a620bfdedf")
    >>> filename = client.download(asset, "asset.jpg")

For complex multi-part assets which have been through preservation actions it may be better to use the data model
and the ``bitstream_content()`` function to fetch the exact bitstream you need.



Add or remove asset and folder icons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can now add and remove icons on assets and folders using the API. The icons will be displayed in the Explorer and
Universal Access interfaces. ::

    >>> folder = client.folder("edf403d0-04af-46b0-ab21-e7a620bfdedf")
    >>>> client.add_thumbnail(folder, "../my-icon.png")

    >>> client.remove_thumbnail(folder)

and for assets ::

    >>> asset = client.asset("edf403d0-04af-46b0-ab21-e7a620bfdedf")
    >>> client.add_thumbnail(asset, "../my-icon.png")

    >>> client.remove_thumbnail(asset)


We also have a function to fetch the thumbnail image for an asset or folder ::

    >>> asset = client.asset("edf403d0-04af-46b0-ab21-e7a620bfdedf")
    >>> filename = client.thumbnail(asset, "thumbnail.jpg")

You can specify the size of the thumbnail by passing a second argument ::

    >>> asset = client.asset("edf403d0-04af-46b0-ab21-e7a620bfdedf")
    >>> filename = client.thumbnail(asset, "thumbnail.jpg", Thumbnail.LARGE)     ## 400×400   pixels
    >>> filename = client.thumbnail(asset, "thumbnail.jpg", Thumbnail.MEDIUM)    ## 150×150   pixels
    >>> filename = client.thumbnail(asset, "thumbnail.jpg", Thumbnail.SMALL)     ## 64×64     pixels


Replacing Content Objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Preservica now supports replacing individual Content Objects within an Asset. The use case here is you have uploaded
a large digitised object such as book and you subsequently discover that a page has been digitised incorrectly.
You would like to replace a single page (Content Object) without having to delete and re-ingest the complete Asset.

The non-blocking (asynchronous) API call will replace the last active Generation of the Content Object ::

    >>> content_object = client.content_object('0f2997f7-728c-4e55-9f92-381ed1260d70')
    >>> file = "C:/book/page421.tiff"
    >>> pid = client.replace_generation_async(content_object, file)

 This will return a process id which can be used to monitor the replacement workflow using ::

    >>> status = client.get_async_progress(pid)

By default the API will generate a new fixity value on the client using the same fixity algorithm as the original Generation you are replacing.
If you want to use a different fixity algorithm or you want to use a pre-calculated or existing fixity value you can specify the
algorithm and value. ::

    >>> content_object = client.content_object('0f2997f7-728c-4e55-9f92-381ed1260d70')
    >>> file = "C:/book/page421.tiff"
    >>> pid = client.replace_generation_async(content_object, file, fixity_algorithm='SHA1', fixity_value='2fd4e1c67a2d28fced849ee1bb76e7391b93eb12')

There is also an synchronous or blocking version which will wait for the replace workflow to complete before returning
back to the caller. ::

    >>> content_object = client.content_object('0f2997f7-728c-4e55-9f92-381ed1260d70')
    >>> file = "C:/book/page421.tiff"
    >>> workflow_status = client.replace_generation_sync(content_object, file)


Export OPEX Package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

pyPreservica allows clients to request a full package export from the system by folder or asset,
this will start an export workflow and download the resulting dissemination package when the export workflow has completed.

The resulting package will be a zipped OPEX formatted package containing the digital content and metadata.
The ``export_opex`` API is a blocking call which will wait for the export workflow to complete before downloading the package. ::

    >>> folder = client.folder('0f2997f7-728c-4e55-9f92-381ed1260d70')
    >>> opex_zip = client.export_opex(folder)

The output is the name of the downloaded zip file in the current working directory.

By default the OPEX package includes metadata, digital content with the latest active generations
and the parent hierarchy.

The API can be called on either a folder or a single asset.  ::

    >>> asset = client.asset('1f2129f7-728c-4e55-9f92-381ed1260d70')
    >>> opex_zip = client.export_opex(asset)

The call also takes the following optional arguments

* ``IncludeContent``            "Content" or "NoContent"
* ``IncludeMetadata``           "Metadata" or "NoMetadata" or "MetadataWithEvents"
* ``IncludedGenerations``       "LatestActive" or "AllActive" or "All"
* ``IncludeParentHierarchy``    "true" or "false"

e.g.    ::


    >>> folder = client.folder('0f2997f7-728c-4e55-9f92-381ed1260d70')
    >>> opex_zip = client.export_opex(folder, IncludeContent="Content", IncludeMetadata="MetadataWithEvents")



Content API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

pyPreservica now contains some experimental interfaces to the content API

https://us.preservica.com/api/content/documentation.html

The content API is a readonly interface which returns json documents rather than XML and which has some duplication
with the entity API, but it does contain search capabilities.

The content API client is created using ::

    >>> from pyPreservica import *
    >>> client = ContentAPI()


object-details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Get the details for a Asset or Folder as a raw json document::

    >>> client = ContentAPI()
    >>> client.object_details("IO", "uuid")
    >>> client.object_details("SO", "uuid")


indexed-fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Get a list of all the indexed metadata fields within the solr server. This includes the default
xip.* fields and any custom indexes which have been created through custom index files. ::

    >>> client = ContentAPI()
    >>> client.indexed_fields():

Search
^^^^^^^^^

Search the repository using a single expression which matches on any indexed field. ::

    >>> client = ContentAPI()
    >>> client.simple_search_csv()

Searches for everything and writes the results to a csv file called "search.csv", by default the csv
columns contain reference, title, description, document_type, parent_ref, security_tag.

You can pass the query term as the first argument (% is the wildcard character) and
the csv file name as the second argument. ::

    >>> client = ContentAPI()
    >>> client.simple_search_csv("%", "results.csv")

    >>> client = ContentAPI()
    >>> client.simple_search_csv("Oxford", "oxford.csv")

    >>> client = ContentAPI()
    >>> client.simple_search_csv("History of Oxford", "history.csv")

The last argument is an optional list of indexed fields which are the csv file columns. ::

    >>> client = ContentAPI()
    >>> metadata_fields = ["xip.reference", "xip.title", "xip.description", "xip.document_type", "xip.parent_ref", "xip.security_descriptor"]
    >>> client.simple_search_csv("%", "results.csv", metadata_fields)


or to include everything except the full text index value ::

    >>> client = ContentAPI()
    >>> everything = list(filter(lambda x: x != "xip.full_text", client.indexed_fields()))
    >>> client.simple_search_csv("%", "results.csv", everything)



Upload API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyPreservica provides some limited capabilities for the Upload Content API

https://developers.preservica.com/api-reference/3-upload-content-s3-compatible

The Upload API can be used for creating, uploading and automatically starting an ingest workflows with pre-created packages.
The Package can be either a native v5 SIP as created from a tool such as the SIP Creator or a native v6 SIP created
manually.
Zipped OPEX packages are also supported. https://developers.preservica.com/documentation/open-preservation-exchange-opex

The package can also be a regular zip file containing just folders and files with or without simple .metadata files.

Uploading Packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The upload API client is created using ::

    >>> from pyPreservica import *
    >>> upload = UploadAPI()

Once you have a client you can use it to upload packages.::

    >>> upload.upload_zip_package("my-package.zip")

Will upload the local zip file and start an ingest workflow if one is enabled.

The zip file can be any of the following:

- Zipped Native XIPv5 Package (i.e. created from the SIP Creator)
- Zipped Native XIPv6 Package (see below)
- Zipped OPEX Package
- Zipped Folder

.. note::
    A Workflow Context must be active for the package upload requests to be successful.

If the package is a simple zipped folder without a manifest XML then you will want to pass information to the
ingest to specify which folder the content should be ingested into.
To specify the parent folder of the ingest pass a folder object as the second argument. ::

    >>> upload = UploadAPI()
    >>> client = EntityAPI()
    >>> folder = client.folder("edf403d0-04af-46b0-ab21-e7a620bfdedf")
    >>> upload.upload_zip_package(path_to_zip_package="my-package.zip", folder=folder)


Monitoring Upload Progress
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``upload_zip_package`` function accepts an optional Callback parameter.
The parameter references a class that pyPreservica invokes intermittently during the transfer operation.

pyPreservica executes the class's ``__call__`` method. For each invocation, the class is passed the
number of bytes transferred up to that point. This information can be used to implement a progress monitor.

The following Callback setting instructs pyPreservica to create an instance of the UploadProgressCallback class.
During the upload, the instance's ``__call__`` method will be invoked intermittently.::

 >>> from pyPreservica import UploadProgressCallback
 >>> my_callback=UploadProgressCallback("my-package.zip")
 >>> client.upload_zip_package(path_to_zip_package="my-package.zip", folder=folder, callback=my_callback)

The default pyPreservica ``UploadProgressCallback`` looks like

.. code:: python

    import os
    import sys
    import threading

    class ProgressPercentage(object):
        def __init__(self, filename):
            self._filename = filename
            self._size = float(os.path.getsize(filename))
            self._seen_so_far = 0
            self._lock = threading.Lock()

        def __call__(self, bytes_amount):
            with self._lock:
                self._seen_so_far += bytes_amount
                percentage = (self._seen_so_far / self._size) * 100
                sys.stdout.write("\r%s  %s / %s  (%.2f%%)" % (self._filename, self._seen_so_far, self._size, percentage))
                sys.stdout.flush()



Creating Packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The UploadAPI module also contains functions for creating XIPv6 packages directly from content files.

To create a package containing a single preservation Content Object (file) as part of an Asset which will
be a child of specified folder ::

    >>> package_path = simple_asset_package(preservation_file="my-image.tiff",  parent_folder=folder)

The output is a path to the zip file which can be passed directly to the ``upload_zip_package`` method::

    >>> client.upload_zip_package(path_to_zip_package=package_path)

By default the Asset title and description will be taken from the file name.

If you don't specify an export folder the new package will be created in the system TEMP folder.
If you want to override this behaviour and explicitly specify the output folder for the package
use the ``export_folder`` argument ::

    >>> package_path = simple_asset_package(preservation_file="my-image.tiff", parent_folder=folder,
                                            export_folder="/mnt/export/packages")


You can specify the Asset title and description using additional keyword arguments. ::

    >>> package_path = simple_asset_package(preservation_file="my-image.tiff", parent_folder=folder,
                                            Title="Asset Title", Description="Asset Description")

You can also add a second Access content object to the asset. This will create an asset
with two representations (Preservation & Access) ::

    >>> package_path = simple_asset_package(preservation_file="my-image.tiff", access_file="my-image.jpg"
                                            parent_folder=folder)

It is possible to configure the asset within the package using the following additional keyword arguments.

*  ``Title``                             Asset Title
*  ``Description``                       Asset Description
*  ``SecurityTag``                       Asset Security Tag
*  ``CustomType``                        Asset Type
*  ``Preservation_Content_Title``        Content Object Title of the Preservation Object
*  ``Preservation_Content_Description``  Content Object Description of the Preservation Object
*  ``Access_Content_Title``              Content Object Title of the Access Object
*  ``Access_Content_Description``        Content Object Description of the Access Object
*  ``Preservation_Generation_Label``     Generation Label for the Preservation Object
*  ``Access_Generation_Label``           Generation Label for the Access Object
*  ``Asset_Metadata``                    Dictionary of metadata schema/documents to add to the Asset
*  ``Identifiers``                       Dictionary of Asset identifiers
*  ``Preservation_files_fixity_callback`` Fixity generation callback for preservation files
*  ``Access_files_fixity_callback``       Fixity generation callback for access files

The package will contain an asset with the following structure.

.. image:: images/simple_asset_package.png


For example to add descriptive metadata and two 3rd party identifiers use the following ::

   >>> metadata = {"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/": "dublin_core.xml"}
   >>> identifiers = {"DOI": "doi:10.1038/nphys1170", "ISBN": "978-3-16-148410-0"}
   >>> package_path = simple_asset_package(preservation_file="my-image.tiff", access_file="my-image.jpg"
                                           parent_folder=folder, Asset_Metadata=metadata, Identifiers=identifiers)



More complex assets can also be defined which contain multiple Content Objects,
for example a book with multiple pages etc.

The ``complex_asset_package`` function takes a collection of preservation files and an optional collection of access files.
It creates a single asset package with multiple content objects per Representation.

Use a **list** collection to preserve the ordering of the content objects within the asset. For example the first
page of a book should be the first item added to the list. ::


    >>> preservation_files = list()
    >>> preservation_files.append("page-1.tiff")
    >>> preservation_files.append("page-2.tiff")
    >>> preservation_files.append("page-3.tiff")

    >>> access_files = list()
    >>> access_files.append("book.pdf")

    >>> package_path = complex_asset_package(preservation_files_list=preservation_files, access_files_list=access_files,
                                             parent_folder=folder)



Custom Fixity Generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default the ``simple_asset_package`` and ``complex_asset_package`` routines will create packages which contain
`SHA1 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1>`_ fixity values.

You can override this default behaviour through the use of the callback options. The pyPreservica library provides
default callbacks for SHA-1, SHA256 & SHA512

* ``Sha1FixityCallBack``
* ``Sha256FixityCallBack``
* ``Sha512FixityCallBack``

To use one of the default callbacks::

    >>> package_path = complex_asset_package(preservation_files_list=preservation_files, access_files_list=access_files,
                                             parent_folder=folder, Preservation_files_fixity_callback=Sha512FixityCallBack())

If you want to re-use existing externally generated fixity values for performance or integrity reasons then you can create a custom callback.
The callback takes the filename and the path of the file and should return a tuple containing the algorithm name
and fixity value ::

    >>> class MyFixityCallback:
    >>>     def __call__(self, filename, full_path):
    >>>         ...
    >>>         ...
    >>>         return "SHA1", value



Spreadsheet Metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

pyPreservica now provides some experimental support for working with metadata in spreadsheets.
The library provides support for generating descriptive metadata XML documents for each row in a spreadsheet, creating
an XSD schema for the XML documents and creating a custom transform for viewing the metadata in the UA portal along side
a custom search index.

Before working with the spreadsheet it should be saved as a UTF-8 CSV document within Excel.

.. image:: images/excel.png

CSV to XML works by extracting each row of a spreadsheet and creating a single XML document for each row.
The spreadsheet columns are the XML attributes.

The XML namespace and root element need to be provided. You also need to specify which column should be used to name the
XML files. ::

    >>> cvs_to_xml(csv_file="my-spreadsheet.csv", root_element="Metadata", file_name_column="filename", xml_namespace="https://test.com/Metadata")

This will read the ``my-spreadsheet.csv`` csv file and create a set of XML documents, one for each row in the csv file.
The XML files will be named after the value in the filename column.

The resulting XML documents will look like ::

    <?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
    <Metadata xmlns="https://test.com/Metadata">
        <Column1>....</Column1>
        <Column2>....</Column2>
        <Column3>....</Column3>
        <Column4>....</Column4>
    </Metadata>


You can create a XSD schema for the documents by calling ::

    >>> cvs_to_xsd(csv_file="my-spreadsheet.csv", root_element="Metadata", xml_namespace="https://test.com/Metadata")

Which will generate a document ``Metadata.xsd`` ::

    <?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
    <xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" attributeFormDefault="unqualified" elementFormDefault="qualified"
               targetNamespace="https://test.com/Metadata">
        <xs:element name="Metadata">
            <xs:complexType>
                <xs:sequence>
                    <xs:element type="xs:string" name="Column1" />
                    <xs:element type="xs:string" name="Column2" />
                    <xs:element type="xs:string" name="Column3" />
                    <xs:element type="xs:string" name="Column4" />
                </xs:sequence>
            </xs:complexType>
        </xs:element>
    </xs:schema>

To display the resulting metadata in the UA portal you will need a CMIS transform to tell Preservica which attributes to
display. You can generate one by calling  ::

    >>> cvs_to_cmis_xslt(csv_file="my-spreadsheet.csv", root_element="Metadata", title="My Metadata Title",
           xml_namespace="https://test.com/Metadata")

You can also auto-generate a custom search index document which will add indexes for each column in the spreadsheet ::

    >>> csv_to_search_xml(csv_file="my-spreadsheet.csv", root_element="Metadata",
           xml_namespace="https://test.com/Metadata")



Ingest Web Video
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

pyPreservica now contains the ability to ingest web video directly from video hosting sites such as YouTube and others.
To use this functionality you need to install the additional Python Project youtube_dl ::

    $ pip install --upgrade youtube_dl


You can ingest video's directly with only the video site URL ::

    >>> upload = UploadAPI()
    >>> client = EntityAPI()
    >>> url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GCr9gljY7s"
    >>> folder = client.folder("edf403d0-04af-46b0-ab21-e7a620bfdedf")
    >>> upload.ingest_web_video(url=url, parent_folder=folder):


It will work with most sites that host video, for example using c-span::

    >>> upload = UploadAPI()
    >>> client = EntityAPI()
    >>> url = "https://www.c-span.org/video/?508691-1/ceremonial-swearing-democratic-senator-padilla"
    >>> folder = client.folder("edf403d0-04af-46b0-ab21-e7a620bfdedf")
    >>> upload.ingest_web_video(url=url, parent_folder=folder):


or UK parliament ::

    >>> upload = UploadAPI()
    >>> client = EntityAPI()
    >>> url = "https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/b886f44b-0e65-47bc-b506-d0e805c01f4b"
    >>> folder = client.folder("edf403d0-04af-46b0-ab21-e7a620bfdedf")
    >>> upload.ingest_web_video(url=url, parent_folder=folder):

The asset will automatically have a title and description pulled from the original site.
You can override the default title, description and security tag with optional arguments and add 3rd party
identifiers. ::

    >>> upload = UploadAPI()
    >>> client = EntityAPI()
    >>> identifier_map = {"Type": "youtube.com"}
    >>> url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GCr9gljY7s"
    >>> title = "Preservica Cloud Edition: Keeping your digital assets safe and accessible"
    >>> folder = client.folder("edf403d0-04af-46b0-ab21-e7a620bfdedf")
    >>> upload.ingest_web_video(url=url, parent_folder=folder, Identifiers=identifier_map, Title=title, SecurityTag="public")

Example Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Updating a descriptive metadata element value**

If you need to bulk update metadata values the following script will check every asset in a folder given by the "folder-uuid"
and find the matching descriptive metadata document by its namespace "your-xml-namespace".
It will then find a particular element in the xml document "your-element-name" and update its value. ::

    from xml.etree import ElementTree
    from pyPreservica import *
    client = EntityAPI()
    folder = client.folder("folder-uuid")
    next_page = None
    while True:
        children = client.children(folder.reference, maximum=10, next_page=next_page)
        for entity in children.results:
            if entity.entity_type is EntityAPI.EntityType.ASSET:
                asset = client.asset(entity.reference)
                for url, schema in asset.metadata.items():
                    if schema == "your-xml-namespace":
                        xml_document = ElementTree.fromstring(client.metadata(url))
                        field_with_error = xml_document.find('.//{your-xml-namespace}your-element-name')
                        if hasattr(field_with_error, 'text'):
                            if field_with_error.text == "Old Value":
                                field_with_error.text = "New Value"
                                asset = client.update_metadata(asset, schema, ElementTree.tostring(xml_document, encoding='UTF-8', xml_declaration=True).decode("utf-8"))
                                print("Updated asset: " + asset.title)
        if not children.has_more:
            break
        else:
            next_page = children.next_page


The following script does the same thing as above but uses the function descendants() rather than children().
The difference is that descendants() does the paging of results internally and combined with
a filter() on the lazy iterator provides a version which does not need the additional while loop or if statement! ::

    client = EntityAPI()
    folder = client.folder("folder-uuid")
    for child_asset in filter(only_assets, client.descendants(folder.reference)):
        asset = client.asset(child_asset.reference)
        document = ElementTree.fromstring(client.metadata_for_entity(asset, "your-xml-namespace"))
        field_with_error = document.find('.//{your-xml-namespace}your-element-name')
        if hasattr(field_with_error, 'text'):
            if field_with_error.text == "Old Value":
                field_with_error.text = "New Value"
                new_xml = ElementTree.tostring(document, encoding='UTF-8', xml_declaration=True).decode("utf-8")
                asset = client.update_metadata(asset, "your-xml-namespace", new_xml)
                print("Updated asset: " + asset.title)

**Adding Metadata from a Spreadsheet**

One common use case which can be solved with pyPreservica is adding descriptive metadata to existing Preservica assets or folders
using metadata held in a spreadsheet. Normally each column in the spreadsheet contains a metadata attribute and each row represents a
different asset.

The following is a short python script which uses pyPreservica to update assets within Preservica
with Dublin Core Metadata held in a spreadsheet.

The spreadsheet should contain a header row. The column name in the header row
should start with the text "dc:" to be included.
There should be one column called "assetId" which contains the reference id for the asset to be updated.

The metadata should be saved as a UTF-8 CSV file called dublincore.csv ::

    import xml
    import csv
    from pyPreservica import *

    OAI_DC = "http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/"
    DC = "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
    XSI = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

    entity = EntityAPI()

    headers = list()
    with open('dublincore.csv', encoding='utf-8-sig', newline='') as csvfile:
        reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
        for row in reader:
            for header in row:
                headers.append(header)
            break
        if 'assetId' in headers:
            for row in reader:
                assetID = None
                xml_object = xml.etree.ElementTree.Element('oai_dc:dc', {"xmlns:oai_dc": OAI_DC, "xmlns:dc": DC, "xmlns:xsi": XSI})
                for value, header in zip(row, headers):
                    if header.startswith('dc:'):
                        xml.etree.ElementTree.SubElement(xml_object, header).text = value
                    elif header.startswith('assetId'):
                        assetID = value
                xml_request = xml.etree.ElementTree.tostring(xml_object, encoding='utf-8', xml_declaration=True).decode('utf-8')
                asset = entity.asset(assetID)
                entity.add_metadata(asset, OAI_DC, xml_request)
        else:
            print("The CSV file should contain a assetId column containing the Preservica identifier for the asset to be updated")



**Creating Searchable Transcripts from Oral Histories**

The following is an example python script which uses a 3rd party Machine Learning API to automatically generate a text
transcript from an audio file such as a WAVE file.
The transcript is then uploaded to Preservica, is stored as metadata attached to an asset and indexed so that the audio or oral history is searchable.

This example uses the AWS https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/ service, but other AI APIs are also available.
AWS provides a free tier https://aws.amazon.com/free/ to allow you to try the service for no cost.

This python script does require a set of AWS credentials to use the AWS transcribe service.

The python script downloads a WAV file using its reference, uploads it to AWS S3 and then starts the transcription service,
when the transcript is available it creates a metadata document containing the text and uploads it to Preservica.::

    import os,time,uuid,xml,boto3,requests
    from pyPreservica import *

    BUCKET = "com.my.transcribe.bucket"
    AWS_KEY = '.....'
    AWS_SECRET = '........'
    REGION = 'eu-west-1'
    ## download the file to the local machine
    client = EntityAPI()
    asset = client.asset('91c73c95-a298-448c-a5a3-2295e5052be3')
    client.download(asset, f"{asset.reference}.wav")
    # upload the file to AWS
    s3_client = boto3.client('s3', region_name=REGION, aws_access_key_id=AWS_KEY, aws_secret_access_key=AWS_SECRET)
    response = s3_client.upload_file(f"{asset.reference}.wav", BUCKET, f"{asset.reference}")
    # Start the transcription service
    transcribe = boto3.client('transcribe', region_name=REGION, aws_access_key_id=KEY, aws_secret_access_key=SECRET)
    job_name = str(uuid.uuid4())
    job_uri = f"https://s3-{REGION}.amazonaws.com/{BUCKET}/{asset.reference}"
    transcribe.start_transcription_job(TranscriptionJobName=job_name,  Media={'MediaFileUri': job_uri}, MediaFormat='wav', LanguageCode='en-US')
    while True:
        status = transcribe.get_transcription_job(TranscriptionJobName=job_name)
        if status['TranscriptionJob']['TranscriptionJobStatus'] in ['COMPLETED', 'FAILED']:
            break
        print("Still working on the transcription....")
        time.sleep(5)
    # upload the transcript text to Preservica
    if status['TranscriptionJob']['TranscriptionJobStatus'] == 'COMPLETED':
        result_url = status['TranscriptionJob']['Transcript']['TranscriptFileUri']
        json = requests.get(result_url).json()
        text = json['results']['transcripts'][0]['transcript']
        xml_object = xml.etree.ElementTree.Element('tns:Transcript', {"xmlns:tns": "https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/"})
        xml.etree.ElementTree.SubElement(xml_object, "Transcription").text = text
        xml_request = xml.etree.ElementTree.tostring(xml_object, encoding='utf-8', xml_declaration=True).decode('utf-8')
        client.add_metadata(asset, "https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/", xml_request)   # add the xml transcript
        s3_client.delete_object(Bucket=BUCKET, Key=asset.reference)   # delete the temp file from s3
        os.remove(f"{asset.reference}.wav")    # delete the local copy
